# The Pigeon Project
A simple C++ Unix Socket Netowork library. 
>"Pigeon library, network made easy!"

## About the software

This software contains the tools to deal with network socket in a simple way. It will enable the user to integrate the network functionality rapidly into their project.

>The original purpose was to let C++ applications communicate with the python scripts, and livestream the numerical simulation over the Internet.  This is only the first step. For the interprocess communication, because one work with the same machine, so the representation of floating-point numbers isn't an issue. However, floating-point numbers are represented in different binary forms for different machine architectures. To overcome this difficulty, one would need data serialization tools. I believe there're plenty of them that have been developed.
