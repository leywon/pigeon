# The Pigeon Project
A simple C++ Unix Socket Netowork library. 
>"Pigeon library, network made easy!"

## About the software

This software contains the tools to deal with network socket in a simple way. It will enable the user to begin sending information over Internet and integrate the network functionality into their project in a quick and convenient manner.

The original motivation is to let the C++ programs communicate with the python programs. Programs written in C++ have good performance in numerical calculation, while python has several powerful data visualization packages. Blending them together is like blending oil with water, which requires some sophisticated manipulation. Another approach is to use this library. With this library, the C++ program is able to send data to the python program, and thus enabling the computing and plotting to be complete in parallel.
